    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Hi, Iâ€™m Darragh, a dedicated web developer from Missoula, Montana. I earned my BS in Computer Science from the University of Denver while competing as a captain on the varsity Division One swim team. Since 2018, I have been passionately working in the field, committed to delivering high-quality products. I strongly believe in kindness and making a difference through my work. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy having conversations with community members, always eager to learn new technologies at hyper speed. My journey in web development has been fueled by a continuous desire to learn and adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
